1.How does K-Means clustering work?
K-Means groups data into K clusters by assigning each point to the nearest cluster centroid, and then updating centroids as the mean of assigned points. This process repeats until convergence.

2.What is the Elbow method?
It’s a technique to find the optimal number of clusters by plotting WCSS (inertia) for various K values. The "elbow" point is where additional clusters don’t significantly reduce WCSS.

3.What are the limitations of K-Means?
Assumes spherical clusters
Sensitive to outliers and initialization
Needs predefined K
Doesn’t handle non-linearly separable data well

4.How does initialization affect results?
Poor initialization can lead to suboptimal clustering. k-means++ helps by choosing better initial centroids.

5.What is inertia in K-Means?
Inertia is the sum of squared distances between data points and their assigned centroids. Lower inertia indicates tighter clusters.

6.What is Silhouette Score?
It measures how similar a point is to its own cluster vs other clusters. Ranges from -1 (bad) to 1 (good). Higher values are better.

7.How do you choose the right number of clusters?
Elbow Method
Silhouette Score
Domain knowledge and experimentation

8.What’s the difference between clustering and classification?
Clustering is unsupervised; labels are not known.
Classification is supervised; models are trained on labeled data.
